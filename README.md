1. Data Exploration and Understanding
Initial Inspection: Load and inspect the train.csv dataset to understand its structure, including feature types and target distribution.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Use appropriate strategies such as imputation or removing affected rows.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and modify existing ones for improved model performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical representations.
3. Data Splitting
Train-Validation Split: Split the data into training and validation sets for model evaluation.
Stratification: Use stratified sampling if the target variable is imbalanced.
4. Model Selection and Training
Baseline Model: Start with a simple model (e.g., logistic regression) as a benchmark.
Advanced Models: Experiment with more complex models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
5. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Performance Metrics: Focus on macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search to fine-tune model performance.
Handling Class Imbalance: Implement techniques like SMOTE or adjust class weights to address imbalanced data.
6. Model Interpretation
Feature Importance: Analyze which features are most influential in the model's predictions.
Error Analysis: Identify and analyze common misclassifications to guide further improvements.
7. Final Evaluation on Test Set
Testing: Evaluate the final model on the test.csv dataset and report macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.
Comparison to Baseline: Compare the final model's performance to the baseline and initial validation results.
8. Documentation and Reporting
Model Documentation: Document the entire process, including methods, challenges, and key findings.
Recommendations: Provide suggestions for integrating the model into SOC workflows and areas for future improvement.
